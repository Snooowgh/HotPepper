## This Project is in beta, use at your own risk.
HOT is an experimental protocol building upon the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance, initially targeting 10 USD per HOT, employs a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance.

Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, HOT is being distributed in the spirit of YFI: no pre-mine, no founder shares, no VC interests â€” simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.
